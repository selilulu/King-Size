# ✨ Welcome to Our Speakty Language Project ✨


## Speakty is a platform where people can play language games, join to chat with others and participate live events to improve their language skills.

💡 The idea behind this language platform is to make people interactively speaking a language that they are willing to learn. 
Come together with other participants and meet up to play games you desire while you are only speaking english.
